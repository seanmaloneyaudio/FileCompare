# FileCompare
This program compares two files and tells the user if/which lines are different. This can be helpful with QA testing the outputted files from software being tested. For example, if one were to programatically test that XML files are exported correctly, you can use the control XML file and compare to the newly outputted file. 

Further improvements:
If made specifically for XML files, we can search only within certain tages, to have a cleaner output.
